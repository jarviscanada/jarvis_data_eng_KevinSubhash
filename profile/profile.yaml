# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "I am a recent graduate from University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science. I did a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics during my undergrad. I first started programming in grade 10
and found it very facinating. After learning about how computer science is very important in the industry, I dedcided to pursue a career in it since I enjoyed it quite a bit. My ultimate goal is to one day work in
the video game industry hence the reason I have taken mathematics as a second major. Over the years, I have been exposed to many concepts such as web development, data structures/algorithms, software design, and
systems programming just to name a few. In terms of experience, I am currently a software developer at Jarvis who has worked on several projects such as the linux cluster monitoring agent."
